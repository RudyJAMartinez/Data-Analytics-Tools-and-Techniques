## Final Project Instructions

The final project will be a visualization on data of your choosing. These data can be similar to those you scrapped in the previous project or an entirely different topic. If you are going to use previous data/topic then I ask that you expand on these data and extend the analysis. Some of you mentioned ways in which you could add to or elaborate on your previous topic - well this is an opportunity to do so. Conversely you may choose to focus on a new topic. There **is not** an expectation of scraping for the new project. You can download pre-curated data sets (e.g. Census Data, survey data, etc.) and use those for your topic.

The purpose of the final project is to display data interactively. You are to either:
* write a report on a topic and include interactive visualizations as seen in the in-class demonstration. If you choose to do this, make sure your data are accessible to others or your html file is loaded on a platform that allows it to be fully visible to others. In other words you may need to host the data on a shared platform so that others can simply run your markdown file and get the html output of your report. The report does not need to be extensive, but should provide clear language as to the what and why of the project. I'm not looking for a research paper, but more of an executive summary that you would show to business partners using a mix of words and interactives.
* create a Shiny App that is published to the Shiny server. This app should be open to the public so that others can easily view it. The app should be easy to use and cover a given topic. Don't just make a bunch of random visualizations, but show a common topic/story with your app.
* create a Tableau dashboard. This will also need to be published in a way that is accessible to others without a license. The Tableau should tell a story about a given topic just like the Shiny App does. 

In creating your interactive visualizations you may choose to use graphs, charts, maps, images, or other media to tell your story. I am not putting a limit on how many of each are needed or which types of visualizations you use - that is up to you and what you find appropriate to tell your data story.

### Tell Me Your Ideas

Please e-mail me by **Friday, April 16th at 5:30PM CST** what you plan to do. Please tell me the data you are planning to use and the visualization method you want (i.e. report, app, dashboard). If you are using your former web scrapping topic then include how you are expanding on the idea and what new data you will be brining in.
